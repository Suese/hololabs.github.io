<h2>FAQ</h2>

<p>
  <strong><em>What is Papercade?</em></strong><br>
Papercade (iOS) is a free, creative, social game where players can easily craft together storygames. Assemble pictures and paper cutouts in a digital shoebox to create dioramas for and about your friends.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>What is a storygame?</em></strong><br>
  A 'storygame' is our own creation. Combine your photos with our cutouts and make any story you want to tell. Make it easy, or make it challenging. Make it funny, or serious. They are your stories and we want to make it simple to be as creative as possible.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>How does Papercade work?</em></strong><br>
  Papercade is a mobile game that combines storytelling with straight-forward game creation. Players take photos from their device to create personalized storygames for and about their friends. A simple storygame can be made in a matter of minutes, or players can create elaborate dioramas and truly make it their own. Once complete the Papercade can be published to a social feed for the create community to play.
