Floor Kids is a charming, finger-dance music game for mobile platforms where
players train to become the best b-boys & b-girls (breakdancers) in their
community. Players use touch-controlled gestures to dance in a series of
action-packed dance battles. Their goal is to unlock a diverse crew of
breakdancers and build up their crew’s skills. Multi-player mode is available
for playing with friends while video replays of a player’s customized dance
routine can be shared online through their social channels such as Facebook
and Twitter.
