<h2>Phonophotopia</h2>

<p>
<em>Phonophotopia</em> is an installation that is part of the McLaren Wall-to-Wall initiative of the National Film Board of Canada (NFB) and the Quartier des Spectacles in Montréal, Canada. This is our first collaboration with recording artist Kid Koala.
</p>
<p>
  Place ‘dots’ (coloured blocks) on a film strip conveyor belt and watch as they come to life as they are projected onto Théâtre Maisonneuve at Place des Arts. Each colour plays a unique sound that is triggered while left/ right placement on the film strip defines the musical note. Compose your own melodies by arranging patterns of dots on film, just as Norman McLaren did back in 1940.
