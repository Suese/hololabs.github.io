## About

Hololabs was founded by Paul Warne and Mike Wozniewski with the aim of
developing new technologies to better serve creativity. With professional
backgrounds in AAA video games and interactive media, the team at Hololabs has
a passion for innovation, spanning from free-to-play mobile games to interactive
web applications, art installations, and virtual reality. They are now in
production of a CMF-funded game-making platform called Papercade, where players
are able to build and share exploratory adventure games with friends.
