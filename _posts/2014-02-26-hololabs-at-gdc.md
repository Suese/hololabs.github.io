Yes folks, the rumors are true. A couple of us from Hololabs will be heading
out west to the Pacific time zone to attend the Game Developers Conference in
San Francisco.

There may or may not be flowers in our hair.

Anyhow, if you will also be going to GDC, and/ or will be in the San Fancisco
region at the same time, drop us a line! We’ll be there for the whole week,
by the way, and we are very much looking forward to seeing old friends, making
new ones, and showing off Papercade.

See you soon!

PS: If email isn’t your thing you can say hi any time over on
Facebook, Google+, or Twitter.
